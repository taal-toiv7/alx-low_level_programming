--------------------------My debugger-------------------------
________________________________________________________________________________
 Debugging basically means the process of error checking programs
 which prohibits desired functionality.

 There are diffrent methods of debugging which are 
	interactive-
	control flow- 
	unit testing-
	intergration testing-
	log file analysis-
	application/system level-
	memory dumps-
	profiling-

________________________________________________________________________________
 The term bug means technical error derived by Grace Hopper in 1940
 the more formal word would be anomly and discrepancy rather than bug 
 error and defacts.
 The debugging process helps to determines where to fix the program and shows
 us how if we need to change certain code or remove it completley making sure
 our we dont implicate costs and keep the program suffiecent for users.
________________________________________________________________________________ Debugging could be as siimple as single code or could be lentghy and tiresome
 it all dependes on the complexity of the program, laguage and the debugging
 skill of who is debugging the program. Oh and also the tools the programmer
 is using to debug the program 
-Generally high level langauges such as Java make debugging easier because of 
 features such as exception handiling and type checking whereby in assembly 
 lauguages like C bugs can cause silient problems such as memory corruption 
 this makes it difficult to spot the initial bug, in casses like these you need
 tools such as memory debugger.
-some software tools that are language specific in nature take the form of 
 static code analysis tools, which look for specific problems, common and rare
 and concentrate on the sematics (data flow) rather than syntax as compilers and interpreters do.
