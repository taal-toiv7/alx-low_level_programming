In C programming, a variadic function adds flexibility to the program.
 It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can be passed.
 The variadic function consists of at least one fixed variable and then
 an ellipsis(â€¦) as the last parameter.
 This enables access to variadic function arguments.
